Computers as Picasso of our times

Includes Final Project.ipynb and CS445_final. Both run Python 3.

Final Project.ipynb has algorithms for K-means, SLIC, and neural style transfer. CS445_final has the algorithm for painterly rendering with curved brushstrokes of multiple sizes. To run them, the target photos should be in the same folder as the notebook. The code has to be modified to reference the correct filenames. Running the notebooks will then result in the outputs for each different method.

To run:
1. Upload target photos to folder, or use existing ones
2. Modify code to include correct filenames
3. Run program
4. Check output results
